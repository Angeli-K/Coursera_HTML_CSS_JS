  "body": "### Hello World!\r\nWelcome to my Repository for the Coursera Course \"HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Development\", in which I am participating in to get first experiences in modern Web Design. If you are interested in knowing more about this course, check out the [Course Homepage](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/). The Course expects me to hand in assignments through Github and gave a brief introduction on how to do that. It also encouraged me the get a closer look on Git and Github but, due to a lack of time, the brief intro has to do for now, so please be tolerant if this page or the files do not look like they should :)\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI have a Master's degree in Psychology from the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (Germany). During my studies, I focused on working- and engineering-psychology and always tried to combine Psychology and Computational Engineering by working in interdisciplinary contexts like Human Computer Interface Design, User Experience, Usability and Virtual Realities. So, this is the next step, I'm very excited and will be thankful for anybody who's willing to accompany me on they way ;)",
